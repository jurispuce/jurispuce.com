## Summary

In this Maven course, I provide startup founders and teams with practical guidance on navigating the complex landscape of EU cybersecurity regulations, including NIS2, DORA, GDPR, CRA, and the EU AI Act.

## Details

Startups already have a ton of things to care about. Cybersecurity is often neglected not by intention but due to a lack of knowledge of what should be done. With regulations like NIS 2, DORA, GDPR, CRA, EU AI Act, and others, the environment is becoming more complex, and "prioritizing what is important" becomes more relevant.

### What You'll Learn

This course is designed to help startup founders and teams understand and implement essential cybersecurity measures without unnecessary complexity. Key topics include:

- **Customer Expectations**: Understanding what enterprise customers will expect from your startup regarding security and compliance
- **Process Implementation**: Which security processes to set up and how to implement them efficiently
- **Complexity Management**: How to avoid unnecessary complexity while maintaining robust security
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Practical approaches to addressing NIS2, DORA, GDPR, CRA, and EU AI Act requirements

### Why This Matters

As the EU regulatory landscape evolves, startups face increasing pressure to demonstrate compliance with cybersecurity standards. This isn't just about avoiding penaltiesâ€”it's about building trust with customers, investors, and partners.

The course provides actionable frameworks that help you:

1. Assess your current security posture against regulatory requirements
2. Identify and prioritize the most critical security measures for your specific business
3. Implement scalable security processes that grow with your business
4. Prepare for security questionnaires and audits from enterprise customers
5. Use compliance as a competitive advantage in the market

### Practical Approach

Rather than theoretical discussions, this course focuses on practical implementation steps tailored to the resource constraints of startups. You'll receive templates, checklists, and real-world examples that can be immediately applied to your organization.

Whether you're a founder, CTO, or team lead at a startup navigating EU markets, this course provides the essential knowledge to futureproof your business against evolving cybersecurity requirements.
