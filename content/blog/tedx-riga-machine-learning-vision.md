## Summary

In this TEDx Riga talk, I explored how machine learning and computer vision technologies are revolutionizing industries and reshaping our daily lives, while discussing the ethical considerations we must address.

## Details

It was an honor to speak at TEDx Riga about the transformative potential of machine learning and computer vision technologies. This presentation delves into both the technical innovations and the human implications of these rapidly evolving fields.

### Key Points

- The evolution of computer vision from rule-based systems to deep learning approaches
- Real-world applications transforming healthcare, transportation, and security
- Ethical considerations including privacy, bias, and responsible AI development
- The future landscape of human-machine collaboration

### Impact and Opportunities

The talk highlights how these technologies are creating new possibilities across industries while emphasizing the importance of thoughtful implementation. I shared examples of how organizations are using computer vision to solve previously intractable problems and the unexpected benefits that have emerged.

I also addressed common misconceptions about AI capabilities and limitations, providing a balanced perspective on where we stand today and what the future might hold.

This TEDx talk aims to inspire technologists, business leaders, and policymakers to approach machine learning and computer vision with both enthusiasm for their potential and mindfulness of their responsible development.
