## Summary

At the 2018 PECB Conference, I discussed how artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are fundamentally changing the cybersecurity landscape, creating both new threats and defensive capabilities.

## Details

This presentation from 2018 provides a forward-looking analysis of AI's impact on cybersecurity that remains relevant today. The talk explores the dual nature of AI in security - as both a powerful defensive tool and a concerning weapon in the hands of attackers.

### Key Topics

- The evolution of AI-powered threat detection and response
- Machine learning applications in anomaly detection and user behavior analytics
- Emerging AI-driven attack vectors and techniques
- The cybersecurity skills gap and how AI can help address workforce challenges
- Ethical considerations in automated security systems

### Industry Implications

The presentation examines how organizations across different sectors were beginning to implement AI-enhanced security measures and the early results of these initiatives. It also addresses the practical challenges of integrating AI into existing security operations centers.

### Looking Back from Today

While this presentation was given in 2018, many of the predictions and trends discussed have materialized in the years since. The talk provides an interesting historical perspective on the early understanding of AI's role in cybersecurity and how the field has evolved.

For security professionals, this presentation offers both strategic insights on AI integration and practical considerations for implementation. It emphasizes that while AI offers powerful new capabilities, human expertise remains essential for effective cybersecurity.
