## Join Our Free Webinar

I'm excited to invite you to an upcoming free webinar where I'll be sharing practical insights on developing and implementing AI usage policies for organizations of all sizes.

**Date:** Thursday, March 13, 2025  
**Time:** 2:30 PM UTC (45 minutes)

## Why This Matters

Many organizations are challenged by "how to use AI" properly. These questions increasingly appear in RFPs and due diligence questionnaires. As a result, "AI usage" is becoming part of existing policies, or in some cases, organizations are developing entirely new policies and procedures.

Without clear guidelines, organizations face several risks:
- Inconsistent AI use across teams
- Potential data privacy violations
- Intellectual property concerns
- Regulatory compliance issues
- Reputational damage

- Implementation strategies that drive adoption
- Measuring policy effectiveness

### 2. AI Risk Management for SaaS
- Identifying and assessing AI-specific risks
- Practical risk mitigation strategies
- Balancing innovation with risk management
- Addressing customer concerns about AI usage

### 3. Using AI Solutions in Your Products
- Ethical considerations for AI integration
- Transparency requirements
- Testing and validation approaches
- Ongoing monitoring and improvement

## Who Should Attend

This webinar is ideal for:
- C-level executives and decision-makers
